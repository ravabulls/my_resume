    <h3>Optimization Based Controller Design For Dead Time Systems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In this study, a simple design method of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller proposed for higher-order (HO)-plus delay time (HOPDT) processes. </li>
            <li>This controller is designed to manage higher-order processes with long-dead times, long time constants, and monotonic or oscillatory responses. </li>
            <li>The method is as per the real and imaginary values of the higher-order processes for the desired settling time and constraints on the complementary sensitivity function to handle the high-frequency noise rejection. </li>
            <li>The procedure seems to be more straightforward, practical and enhanced performance can be expected of the various processes.</li>
        </ul>
